          Mineral deposits are where one or more minerals have been concentrated in the earth’s crust by geological processes. Ore deposits contain minerals that are economically profitable. Thus, all ore deposits are mineral deposits, but the converse is not true. Examples of valuable ore deposits often store metals such as copper, gold, and iron. Lesser known examples are non-metallic and fossil fuel deposits. Now, the value of an ore depends on the market’s laws of supply and demand, but can also be driven by advancing technology or international trade and prices.

        <p style="text-align-last: right; -moz-text-align-last: right;"><br>
          Grade refers to the proportion of the extractable metal from the rock itself. It is the percentage of concentration. Gangue denotes the undesirable, excess part of the ore. But although an ore’s profitability, amount of reserves, and grade are important aspects to consider, there are negative factors like costs, an unstable market, and high upfront expenses which could deem a rich deposit to be, in the final analysis, uneconomical.

        <hr style="background-color: darkblue">
        <p>In such a deposit, metals are accumulated and enriched in the magma chamber.</p>
        <p>When the magma cools and minerals crystallize, heavier and denser minerals sink to the bottom of the chamber, forming a layered deposit.</p> 
        <p>There are also situations where the metal is distributed evenly throughout the igneous rock, especially in low-concentrations, which are called a disseminated deposit.</p> 
        <p>Magmatic cumulates are rocks formed as a result of several minerals that are locally concentrated during cooling and crystallization.</p>

        <hr style="background-color: darkblue">
        <p>Hot fluids flowing through open spaces in rocks begin to localize and concentrate minerals together.</p>
        <p>In hydrothermal deposits, a nearby hot igneous body will circulate groundwater. Radioactive decay or faulting crust may also provide the heat necessary.</p>
        <p>It requires the chemical reaction of deposition as well, which is caused by boiling or mixing with a colder solution.</p>
        <p>In open fractures or cool waters, the minerals could be precipitated upwards, then concentrate there.</p>

        <hr style="background-color: darkblue">
        <p>Mechanically, sedimentary mineral deposits are concentrated by virtue of the ore mineral surviving destruction, although the surrounding rock it is embedded in does not.</p>
        <p>Black magnetic sand is an example of such a process. If consolidated, it will end up forming a bed of iron ore.</p>
        <p>Weathering can also concentrate ore bodies by removing excess rock <br>to leave the richer ones.</p>
        <p>Another way is by solution of the valuable material and re-deposition at a lower level.</p>

        <p>Here, convergent movements of plate boundaries result in uplift, thereby exposing rock layers. This then allows for erosion and weathering.</p>
        <p>Stable, heavy minerals are freed and washed downslope into streams, <br>where they are concentrated.</p>
        <p>Eluvial placers form on hillslopes acted on by rainfall and wind.</p>
        <p>Beach placers form on seashores, where waves and currents shift minerals.</p>
        <p>Aeolian placers form on arid areas, since the main agent is wind.</p>

        <p>Metamorphic deposits are formed regardless if the temperature and pressure is low or high, although there are effects.</p>
        <p>Ore deposits formed earlier will undergo both textural and mineral changes.</p>

          The Philippines has unfortunately not used its natural resources very well in the past. Filipinos are endowed with an abundance of minerals. In 1994, the estimated metallic reserves were at around 7 billion metric tons. The refractory chromite resource in Zambales is also considered to be one of the largest in the world. Mining is valuable to us even now, as mining in CARAGA and MIMAROPA contribute 20% of their regional GDP. Furthermore, even small-scale operations benefit the country’s production. Small-scale mining for gold comprises more than 70% of total gold mined, far exceeding all the gold mines put together.

          Contrary to initial opinion, there has been data that mining activity makes the local area poorer, not richer. Mining in 2009 had the highest poverty incidence since 1988, even surpassing the agricultural sector. It turns out that most of the Philippines mineral production becomes foreign export. Moreover, in 2011 it is estimated that 19,000 children were working in 45 small-scale gold mines. In many families, all have no choice but to risk their lives to mine. However, studies show that mining is associated with shorter relative distance to health facilities and water sources. The region of CARAGA also does benefit monetarily, increasing household income by more than 5,000 pesos. The country’s goal, then, is responsible mining with consideration for those in poverty. But all things considered, it remains a set of open questions and an ongoing debate, as most important things must be.

          At first glance, sustainable mining might sound inherently contradictory. We cannot really reuse or put back minerals into rocks to be extracted again. However, recent years have emphasized any mining operation’s most valuable asset, the labor force. We have to sustain our workers and to ensure they retain good health in often horrid conditions. This entails a safe and regulated work environment, the abolishment of abusive child labor that persists in many poorer countries, and the ingenuity of technology to conserve our limited minerals by making the most out of only few and inexpensive resources. Ores are non-renewable, yes, but as high-grade deposits grow more scarce, sustainable development now is an area of research in order to extract metals and minerals from lower-grade deposits.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align-last: right; -moz-text-align-last: right;"><br>
          There is also the concept of benefication, which is the process of removing the gangue or excess rock from the mineral. Our methods of extracting from lower-grade ores might not be the most cost-efficient. With future advancements in benefication, perhaps a low-grade may almost be considered a high-grade. Lastly, as we consider the environment and what mining does to the landscape, we can also sustain it during the process of mining itself. There is cutting-edge research into ore-sand. This is a process that separates and repurposes sand-like materials from mine waste. Sustaining sand as a resource does two things: supply the tripled demand for sand in urban construction, and it also reduces the waste thrown into the garbage stream of a mining operation.
